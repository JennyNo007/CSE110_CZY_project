## Hey! My name is Zhenyi Chen. I am a senior math-computer science student and I transferred to UCSD last fall. I decided to double major in Cognitive Science this summer so I have to extend my graduation year to 2023.
As a programmer, I started to code using python in high school. I learnt Cpp in college when I was a freshman and Java in sophomore. I tried to practive more in my spare time but it seems that taking classes is the most efficient way to practice coding. I know that I have to pratice more often but hard to keep up... :(
- I like to watch movies, play tennis and have a fun time with my friends and cats.
