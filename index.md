## As a programmer
 I started to code using python in high school. I learnt C++ in college when I was a freshman and Java in sophomore. I tried to practive more in my spare time but it seems that taking classes is the most efficient way to practice coding. I know that I have to pratice more often but it is hard to keep up... :( ~~I am happy at least my work has tons of repay!~~
